# Each strategy typically has a number of different conditions 
# condn_1, condn_2, etc. that must satisfied in order to be an SPNE. 
# Some conditions are sufficient for others, which makes the others 
# superfluous, e.g., a sequence condn_2 -> condn_1 -> cond_4 -> ... 
# means cond_1, cond_4, ... are superfluous, and condn_2 is the only
# necessary condition of this set. Others might have no relationships
# with the others, and they are independently necessary for the 
# strategy to be a SPNE.
#
# Given the one-shot deviation payoff differences, for every strategy
# with the potential to be SPNE, identify which of the conditions are
# necessary (if any).
